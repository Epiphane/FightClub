 *
 * This is a cool little game to fight your friends on Slack or other (coming soonâ„¢)
 * chat clients.
 *
 * You can either include this file (fight.php) and use it, or include slack.php
 * and it will handle the re-parameterizing for Slack

/*
 * COUPLE NOTES:
 * 
 * 1) If you have a custom __autoload function, comment out the line that
 *    includes autoload.php
 * 2) Make sure you create a config.php file that defines:
 *    - FIGHT_DB_HOST
 *    - FIGHT_DB_USER
 *    - FIGHT_DB_PASS
 *    - FIGHT_DB_NAME
 *    - NO_AUTOLOAD (if you don't want to include this version of autoload)
 *
